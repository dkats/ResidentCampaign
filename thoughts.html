<h1>Welcome</h1>

During the preclinical years of medical school, I realized that being a doctor is more than healing patients at the bedside. I key component is advocacy, because if I don't speak up, who will? This inspired me to start writing stories about patients that I feel can serve as teaching points. After starting to write about my experiences, it became a way for me to de-stress and to release some of the feelings that I have to bottle up in the moment. I've also been writing about random, non-medical thoughts that I feel the itch to put in writing.
<br /><br />
If I offend you, I'm sorry. Please <a href="mailto:dkats12@gmail.com">email me</a> and tell me why I am wrong or what I can do to improve. Part of the reason I put these thoughts on the internet is to grow as a person, so I would appreciate any and all guidance.
<br /><br />
Thank you.
