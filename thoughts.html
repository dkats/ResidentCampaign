<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>During the preclinical years of medical school, I realized that being a doctor is more than healing patients at the bedside. A key component is advocacy, because if I don't speak up, who will? There's a ridiculous amount of misinformation spreading through the social and news media, but we have an opportunity to counter it! This inspired me to start writing stories about patients that I feel can serve as teaching points. Writing also became a way for me to de-stress and to process some of the feelings that I have to bottle up in the moment.</p>

<p>Most of these are raw and emotional, so if I offend you, I'm sorry; it really wasn't the intention. Please <a href="mailto:djk175@case.com">email me</a> and tell me why I am wrong or what I can do to improve. Part of the reason I put these thoughts on the internet is to grow as a person, so I would appreciate any and all guidance.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
