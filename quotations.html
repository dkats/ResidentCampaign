<h3>Random quotations that mean something to me (in no particular order).</h3>

<p><q>It's all about the little people in the forest.</q><br />&mdash; Dr. George Abbott White (high school newspaper advisor)</p>

<p><q>Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.</q><br />&mdash; Theodore Roosevelt (allegedly)</p>

<p><q>I do not believe we can understand our patients' bodies if we do not understand something about who they are as human beings, and what their lives are like.</q><br />&mdash; Dr. Colleen Farrell, <a href="http://closler.org/lifelong-learning-in-clinical-excellence/social-history-as-story" target="_blank"><em>Social History as a Story</em></a></p>

<p><q>Just because your voice now goes all across the world does not mean you are any wiser than when it only went to the end of the bar.</q><br />&mdash; Edward R. Murrow</p>

<p><q>Just because you're in this to reduce human suffering, doesn't mean you have to increase your own.</q><br />&mdash; Dominic Vitello (medical school classmate)</p>

<p><q>'Every listener hears a different story,' I reminded him. 'The fact that she shares something different with her nurse than what she tells you or me is to be expected,' I explained. I knew she had different answers for different people. We each had different relationships with her. 'It doesn't devalue what she told you, it's just different,' I added.</q><br />&mdash; Dr. Rana Awdish, <em>In Shock (p. 6)</em></p>

<p><q>I knew we valued the cure, the goal, the win. We were far less comfortable in the gray, shadowed area of suffering.</q><br />&mdash; Dr. Rana Awdish, <em>In Shock (p. 9)</em></p>

<p><q>We aren't trained to see our patients. We are trained to see pathology.</q><br />&mdash; Dr. Rana Awdish, <em>In Shock (p. 26)</em></p>
