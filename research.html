<h2 id="currinterests">Current Interests</h2>

	<h3>Down Syndrome &mdash; Massachusetts General Hospital for Children <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/services/treatmentprograms.aspx?id=1701">Down Syndrome Program</a> with <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/services/down-syndrome/brian-skotko-md-mpp.aspx">Dr. Brian Skotko</a></h3>

		<p><u>Infantile spasms in children with Down syndrome</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the process of writing a review of the current literature.</li>
			<li>We interviewed a parent of every patient with Down syndrome, infantile spasms, and an electronic record at MGH, and performed a chart review on all of them, to look at the developmental sequelae of infantile spasms.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><u>Quality of life for people with Down syndrome</u>: We created an international group of Down syndrome experts to develop surveys that will assess the quality of life for people with Down syndrome around the world. Our goal is to identify countries that we should learn from, as well as countries that need more resources. This is a very long-term project, but we hope that the first version of our survey will be ready by 2021.</p>

	<h3>EHR</h3>

		<p>I am interested in working with electronic health records (EHR). There are two main ways in which I would like to explore EHR: firstly, using "big data" to look for previously invisible trends and patterns; and secondly, optimizing the way in which EHR can be used to make healthcare <em>safe</em> for patients and to help healthcare providers deliver the best care possible.</p>

		<p>EHR provides an immense, yet structured, mass of data that is begging to be analyzed in ways that were not possible with paper charts. Processing information from thousands, tens of thousands, or even more patients is limited only by computer power, which cannot compare to the previously used method of medical student chart review. However, with great data comes great responsibility; that is, the new challenge is to identify what is <em>useful</em> and <em>actionable</em>. EHR-based research meshes perfectly with my love of computers and math, and I have begun to enter the informatics space, which will hopefully join me throughout my career.</p>

		<p>While the concept of EHR was originally developed with a business purpose, it is an amazing opportunity to make healthcare workers' lives easier. While some have developed a hate of EHR and claim to prefer paper charts, I see this as a repairable fault of specific EHR systems; there is no reason why computers cannot surpass the utility of paper. While I currently do not have a plan for improving EHR to better interact with healthcare providers, I will look to move into this space in the future. My first goal will be to make strides towards interoperability, that is, the ability of different EHRs to work together and share information. I believe that without interoperability, true patient safety is not possible, and this is a pressing, yet easily fixable (in terms of technical complexity) issue.</p>
