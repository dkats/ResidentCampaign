	<h3>Down Syndrome &mdash; Massachusetts General Hospital for Children <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/services/treatmentprograms.aspx?id=1701">Down Syndrome Program</a> with <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/services/down-syndrome/brian-skotko-md-mpp.aspx">Brian Skotko, MD, MPP</a></h3>

		<p><u>Infantile spasms in children with Down syndrome</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reviewed the current literature (preparing for submission)</li>
			<li>We interviewed a parent of every patient with Down syndrome, infantile spasms, and an electronic record at MGH, and performed a chart review on all of them, to look at the developmental sequelae of infantile spasms</li>
		</ul>

		<p><u>Quality of life for people with Down syndrome</u>: We created an international group of Down syndrome experts to develop surveys that will assess the quality of life for people with Down syndrome around the world. Our goal is to identify countries that we should learn from, as well as countries that need more resources. This is a very long-term project, but we hope that the first version of our survey will be ready by 2021.</p>

	<h3>Lung Cancer Screening &mdash; MetroHealth System with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G0cAReYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Yasir Tarabichi, MD, MSCR</a></h3>

		<p><u>Inaccuracy of smoking history documentation in electronic health records</u>: As we showed in <a href="http://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(17)33076-3/fulltext" target="_blank"><em>CHEST</em> (2018)</a>, smoking histories are wildly inaccurate in EHRs. Ideally, patients who were active smokers would have their duration of smoking increased over time (duh), and the amount they smoked ("pack-years") would increase as well (double duh). But that's not what we saw. Patients' smoking data did wild things, zig-zagging all over the place. Active smokers' durations of smoking would either stay constant over time or even decrease, as would their pack-years!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What does this mean for lung cancer screening?</li>
			<li>What effect does this have on lung cancer prediction?</li>
		</ul>

		<p><u>Provider habits with respect to ordering lung cancer screening?</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Do providers have an intuitive sense of lung cancer risk?</li>
			<li>What affects whether providers order lung cancer screening?</li>
			<li>Do different variables affect ordering lung cancer screening vs. completion of the order?</li>
		</ul>

		<p><u>Improving prediction of lung cancer</u>: Since documentation of smoking history in EHRs is so inaccurate, what can we do to clean the data and make it more useful? We developed "history-conscious" metrics that attempt to be more representative of patients' <em>true</em> smoking exposures just by using data that is already in the EHR. So far, we have surprisingly found that these metrics do <em>not</em> make lung cancer risk calculators any more senstive or specific, but we will continue exploring ways to improve lung cancer predictions to better pick candidates for lung cancer screening.</p>

	<h3>EHR</h3>

		<p>EHR provides an immense, yet structured, mass of data that is begging to be analyzed in ways that were not possible with paper charts. Processing information from thousands, tens of thousands, or even more patients is limited only by computer power, which cannot compare to the previously used method of manual chart review. However, with great data comes great responsibility; that is, the new challenge is to identify what is <em>useful</em> and <em>actionable</em>. EHR-based research meshes perfectly with my love of computers and math, and I have begun to enter the informatics space, which will hopefully join me throughout my career.</p>

		<p>While the concept of EHR was originally developed with a business purpose, it is an amazing opportunity to make healthcare workers' lives easier. While some have developed a hate of EHR and claim to prefer paper charts, I see this as a fixable fault of specific EHR systems; there is no reason why computers cannot surpass the utility of paper. While I currently do not have a plan for improving EHR to better interact with healthcare providers, I will look towards this goal in the future. One of the most important changes to make is interoperability, that is, the ability of different EHRs to work together and share information across hospital systems. I believe that without interoperability, true patient safety is not possible, and this is a pressing, yet easily fixable (in terms of technical complexity) issue.</p>

	<h3>Inosine-5'-monophosphate Dehydrogenase &mdash; <a href="http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/hedstromlab/Site/Home.html">Lizbeth Hedstrom, PhD</a>, Brandeis University</h3>

		<p>My <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10192/32359">undergraduate honors thesis</a> (biochemistry) involved studying the previously undescribed interactions between inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and RNA polymerase and between IMPDH and ribosomes. IMPDH's main function is to convert inosine monophosphate to xanthine monophosphate as part of the synthesis of guanine nucleotides (the G building blocks of DNA and RNA). A previous member of the Hedstrom Lab had found that IMPDH binds to RNA polymerase and separately to ribsomes, even though IMPDH's catalytic function has nothing to do with either of them. While I was not able to reproduce the previous student's results, I developed a way of gene editing the <em>E. coli</em> that was much cleaner than the standard method. Usually when modifying genes, it's necessary to insert a "scar" sequence that theoretically doesn't do anything, but does add noncoding DNA. However, I was able to edit the DNA of my bacteria without any scar, making my cells as close to wild type as possible.</p>
