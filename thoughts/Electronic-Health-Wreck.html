<h1>Electronic Health Wreck</h1>

<p><em>Note: Patient information was changed to protect privacy.</em></p>

<p><u>April 2017</u></p>

<p>I met Kevin halfway into my first year of medical school. As part of a new elective, I was assigned to follow him and his family to their various medical appointments for a full year, giving me the opportunity to see medicine not from the doctor’s view, but the patient’s view.</p>

<p>After months of delays due to paperwork and waiting on administration (the side of medicine I’m choosing to pretend doesn’t exist for the time being), I accompanied Kevin to a CT scan appointment. We waited and chatted for a while in the waiting room before getting taken back to another waiting area. I watched as he received an IV, but wondered why it was needed for a CT scan. While waiting for the scan to be done, I had one of my proudest moments of my infantile medical career: I realized that the IV was for an injection of contrast that would light up his tumors in bright white on the scans, making them stand out from the surrounding tissue!</p>

<p>A few hours later, we were sitting at an appointment with Kevin’s radiation oncologist to plan out his radiation treatment. As the appointment came to an end (after what felt like a five-minute conversation with the doctor following an hour in the waiting room), Kevin asked the doctor why he received an injection of contrast during the CT. Well, duh, I thought, it was so the tumors would stand out and we could see how far the cancer had spread.</p>

<p>Except it’s not that straightforward.</p>

<p>CT scans work by mapping out how dense different tissues are: very dense material (e.g. bone) is white, while relatively empty spaces (e.g. lungs) are black. Iodine is used in the contrast injection because it’s a very heavy element and shows up as white on the CT, while pretty much everything other than bone is black or gray. What made this trick work even better, was that Kevin’s cancer was a thyroid cancer, and thyroid is the only tissue in the body that sucks up iodine. So, as soon as the injection of iodine went into Kevin’s bloodstream, it concentrated in the tumor cells. Like little emergency flares in a dark forest, Kevin’s cancer cells glowed in his CT scan.</p>

<p>In my mind, this seemed like the perfect way to show Kevin what was going on with his body. Except there was a tiny problem. Kevin’s cancer was being treated in three ways: surgery, radiation therapy, and a third component that exploited the very same logic as the contrast. Surgery aimed to cut out as many tumor cells as possible, while radiation and the third therapy were supposed to clean up the leftovers. The plan was to inject Kevin with radioactive iodine, which would get sucked up by the tumor cells and would kill them with radiation straight at the source of the cancer.</p>

<p>Here’s where Kevin’s question came in. To get the radioactive iodine treatment, we had to make sure that the tumor cells would suck it all up. The thyroid tissue is smart, though. If it’s already loaded with iodine, it’ll stop sucking it up from the blood (and the extra iodine will just come out in the urine). Kevin’s endocrinologist (who was managing the radioactive iodine treatment) had explained this to Kevin and said that it takes three months to empty out the iodine stores in the body. When Kevin got the shot of contrast for the CT, his thyroid cells (including the tumor) reloaded their nearly empty stores and were full again.</p>

<p>The radiation oncologist looked at Kevin bewildered and said that the contrast should not have been given, because the radioactive iodine therapy would now have to be postponed for another three months.</p>

<p>Three months.</p>

<p>The standard plan is to do radioactive iodine right before starting radiation therapy, so that the cancer cells get bombarded from two directions at the same time. Now, that one little shot messed up Kevin’s treatment. Will this mistake make a difference in his outcome? No one knows. Would his treatment go better if it was done the right way? We’ll never find out. Kevin’s six children will never know, either.</p>

<p>This was the smooth and flawless world of medicine that I was entering.</p>

<p>What makes this more unacceptable to me—more than knowing that Kevin watched this train wreck happen while assuming that the doctors and their staffs knew what they were doing—is that it happened with doctors who work at the same cancer center. This didn’t happen in the middle of nowhere where the doctors aren’t used to handling these cases. This didn’t happen between different hospital systems without organized forms of communication. This happened at a cancer center that undoubtedly manages many, many patients just like Kevin. Why didn’t the doctors talk to each other to warn that Kevin can’t have any CTs with contrast? Why didn’t the CT technicians double-check to make sure that it was ok to give him the injection? Why didn’t the electronical health record flag this when the order was placed?</p>

<p>Medicine will never be perfect. As technology gets more advanced, there are more opportunities for things to go wrong. Yet, this was more than wrong. This was an outright failure. Kevin had enough go wrong with his health before this. This was an easy mistake to avoid, yet the system failed him and his family.</p>
