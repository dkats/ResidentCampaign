<h1>My First Death</h1>

<p><em>NOTE: Details of the patient and story were changed to protect privacy.</em></p>

<p><u>Medical School, Year 4</u></p>

<p>I see a girl squatting on the ground playing next to her dad. A girl laughing with her mom. A girl with blue eyes lighting up the world and blonde hair blossoming from her head. A girl who can grow up to be anyone who she wants to be.</p>

<p>I see a girl I don’t recognize, but have taken care of every single day for a month. I have looked at her face. I have listened to her heart and her lungs. I have felt her pulses. I know every one of the medications that has entered her body, but I don’t know <em>her</em>.</p>

<p>I turn my head away from the wall of photos to look at Bethany. A breathing tube sticks out of her mouth. A feeding tube comes out of her nose. Her eyes have dried tears crusting around them. Her abdomen is taped from her belly button to her chest to cover a huge and bloody incision. A plastic pouch comes out below her ribs to collect the stool dumped out by her intestines through a hole in her skin. Countless plastic tubes pump medicines into her bloodstream. Her wrists are in restraints to keep her from pulling at the tubes.</p>

<p>This can’t be the girl in the photos. But it is.</p>

<p>We can’t explain why her body stopped making white blood cells. Without them—the main part of the immune system—she developed a raging infection that destroyed most of her liver and likely invaded her entire body. We pumped her full of antibiotics—five different ones—but we haven’t made any progress; the infection has too large of a head start.</p>

<p>Bethany has been suffering. For weeks. Her mom repeatedly pleads with us to make her more comfortable, but her blood pressures fall when we increase her already robust collection of pain medicines. Her parents can’t give up the hope of bringing their daughter back in order to prioritize comfort over treatment.</p>

<p>The only way to cure Bethany is with a bone marrow transplant (BMT). But to get a BMT, we have to get rid of her raging infection. To get rid of her raging infection, Bethany needs an immune system. But the reason she needs a BMT is to give her the immune system that she doesn’t have. To be cured, she needs to have been cured already.</p>

<p>It feels wrong to keep treating her. All of the doctors and nurses agree that the chance of her getting better is essentially zero. We have meetings with Bethany’s parents several times a week and have repeatedly told them the prognosis. But we give them a choice every time: keep trying to treat or stop. We do not acknowledge comfort care as a treatment; rather, it is presented as the absence of it.</p>

<p>Of course, Bethany’s parents can’t pick that option. Who could give up hope that their memories would come back to life? That their daughter would sleep inside their house again? Play in the grass again? Be healthy again?</p>

<p>But what options do they have? There are three ways to get the infection out of Bethany’s body: 1) cut it out, 2) drain it, and 3) “Plan Z.”</p>

<p>The surgeons will not cut out the infected part of Bethany’s liver. She is already getting daily blood transfusions even without any new holes in her body. The chance of her surviving a major operation like that is too low; it would essentially be murder. We can’t drain her liver for the same reason (and draining it with a needle might make the infection spread into the rest of the abdomen through the newly formed hole—not good).</p>

<p>There is one final hope: Plan Z, a procedure that would trigger a huge—and very likely deadly—immune response from her body. All the doctors agree that it would likely kill her. The procedure is so rare that even the most famous and big-name hospitals in the world do it no more than once per year. It is incredibly dangerous, but it is the last chance of getting Bethany ready for a BMT.</p>

<p>Her parents chose to do it, and, two days later, on my third to last day in the hospital, Plan Z begins. Bethany is scheduled to receive donor white blood cells every day for two weeks. The process is similar to receiving red blood cells, but is much more dangerous because it will give her a new immune system and throw it into overdrive right away. At 11pm on my third to last day of the rotation, Bethany receives her first transfusion.</p>

<p>I come in the next morning scared of what I will hear from the overnight resident. But everything went smoothly. Bethany is the same as I had left her. She then has a perfectly average day (by her standards), and I go home again, eager to come back the next day. I walk in on my last day, again expecting the worst. But Bethany has done well again. Her blood pressures dipped a bit, but they had been doing that on-and-off for weeks. Nothing new.</p>

<p>Maybe it is actually going to be ok? But I can’t imagine a happy ending to Bethany’s story. All of Bethany’s doctors—top physicians with loads of experience, including seeing many other patients go through this same procedure—had said that it is near impossible for Bethany to survive. I don’t want to leave Bethany. I want to see the end. But my month-long rotation has abruptly come to an end and I have to leave.</p>

<p>One week later, ten days after Bethany’s first transfusion, I wake up to a text from a resident who had taken care of Bethany with me. Bethany had died overnight—peacefully, with family by her side.</p>

<p>In the days since that text, I have been thinking about how we took care of Bethany. Was giving her the white blood cells the right thing to do? Even though it was her only chance to get a BMT, we were certain that it would kill her, so should we have even offered it as an option?</p>

<p>Would she have died if we didn’t give it to her? I think so. Would she have lived for more than ten days? There’s really no way to know, but it’s possible. But the end of Bethany’s life wasn’t about how many days she would live; it was about <em>how</em> she would live them. In pain? Suffering? Unable to recognize her parents?</p>

<p>I will always regret not being around for the last week of Bethany’s life. It was not my choice, but I wish I could have stayed for the end. I wanted to make sure she was comfortable. She was <em>my</em> patient, <em>my</em> responsibility. In the end, when I—and likely everyone else—reflect on the end to her life, her (dis)comfort is what comes to mind. Which is how I think about the decision to offer and give her the white blood cell transfusions. If the end of Bethany’s life had lasted longer than a week (with or without the cells), I’m convinced that she would have suffered more.</p>

<p>Without the cells, she was in a purgatory between health and death. The cells carried with them the promise of bringing her to one of those two endpoints. If she had not received them, she likely would have died a slow and miserable death as the infection further destroyed her liver (and possibly spread to other parts of her body).</p>

<p>No death is a good outcome, but there is a difference between an excruciating death and a peaceful one. While the white blood cells didn’t save Bethany, they saved her from being slowly ravaged by infection and they took the decisions out of her parents’ hands. No parent should choose to take treatments away from their child—no matter how unlikely they are to provide benefit.</p>

<p>In the end, we did target Bethany’s discomfort with our treatments and made sure that her last weeks were as comfortable as they could be. I wish we could have cured her. I wish she could be back home with her family. But I do not wish that we had done anything differently. We should have reframed palliation in a more active and positive light, but we made her comfortable even during her intense treatments, regardless of what our official goal was. She died quietly with her family around her, and that’s what matters in the end.</p>
