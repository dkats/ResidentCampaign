<h1>The Executioner</h1>

<p><em>Note: I wrote the first draft of this story the day it happened. I tried to keep my editing to a minimum to leave as much of my raw emotion as possible.</em></p>

<p><u>Medical School, Year 3</u></p>

<p>For the past few days in the Neuro ICU, I had heard about a patient who was given Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) status. I knew this meant she was likely going to die, but some of our other DNAR patients had been in the unit longer than me, so maybe she would stick around for a while. As we (the residents, the attending, and I) made our way around the patients today, we walked into her room. A woman, tears in her eyes, was holding the patient’s hand. I followed the attending as he examined the patient. I looked at her blond hair with an inch of brown roots poking through the scalp. I saw her pink skin. I watched her chest rise and fall with each of the ventilator’s breaths. Every now and then she stirred, almost as if she was trying to stretch after a long nap. To anyone outside of the medical field, she looked alive—in bad shape, but still alive. But I knew this was different. When we opened her eyes, her pupils were huge and didn’t get any smaller when we shined a light right into them. When we turned her head side to side, her eyes didn’t stay staring straight ahead (which they would if the most basic part of the brain, the brainstem, was working properly). She didn’t react to any kind of pain. When we turned off her ventilator, she didn’t breathe for five or ten seconds. Her heart was beating, but she was dead.</p>

<p>Later in the day, we heard that her husband had approved organ donation. The residents asked if I wanted to go draw a blood sample, to which I said yes. We walked into the room and I saw the tears in the husband’s eyes. His wife was dead, but he was still keeping her body company. We asked if we could draw the blood, and he left the room to take a break. I felt for the dead patient’s pulse and gently poked the needle in, aiming for an artery in her warm, seemingly living hand. Every 30 seconds or so, she would do her characteristic movements, stretching out her arm with my needle inside it. Yet, when I tried (and failed) to find her artery, poking my needle deeper and deeper into her wrist, she was perfectly still, not feeling any pain. I worried about poking through a nerve or some other important structure. But did it matter?</p>

<p>Later, the attending came by to fully test whether the patient was truly “brain dead.” We walked in silently as the attending spoke to the husband about organ donation. “It’s on her driver’s license, so if she wants it, that’s what I’ll do.” The husband watched the attending pinching his wife’s body (already bruised from previous pinches), squeezing her nails against my metal tuning fork, and opening her lifeless eyes. We poured ice water into her ears. We turned off her ventilator and watched her breathing stop. With each test, I felt more and more responsible for her death. Not for causing it, but for proving it. The attending explained to the husband that her movements were simply reflexes ingrained in her spinal cord (like when we stretch our arms out to break a fall), and were not signs of life. As we finished, the husband made one last plea, “is there any chance…?” “No.” He knew the answer already, but couldn’t help but hold onto a morsel of hope. Just two days ago, his wife was perfectly fine, not aware that a blood vessel in her brain was about to pop, filling her skull with blood and ending her life well before her 50th birthday.</p>

<p>I wanted to go up to the husband and tell him, “I’m so sorry.” But I couldn’t. My eyes were watering and I was close to crying for the woman’s lost life and her husband’s love for her. There was no way I could speak without losing my composure. I couldn’t imagine the strength it took for him to talk to us about donating his wife’s organs just two days after he last spoke to her. I walked out of the room without even looking the patient’s husband in the eyes. Death got the better of me.</p>

<p>Medicine is a losing game. Each and every one of my patients will die. Less than three weeks into my clinical years, this was the first time—and unfortunately not the last—that death beat me.</p>
