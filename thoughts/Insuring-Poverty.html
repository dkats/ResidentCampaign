<h1>Insuring Poverty</h1>

<p><em>Note: Patient information was changed to protect privacy.</em></p>

<p><u>Medical School, Year 1</u></p>

<p>I met Ashley halfway into my first year of medical school. I signed up for a brand-new elective, which assigned me to follow her and her family to their various medical appointments for a full year, giving me the opportunity to see medicine from the patient’s view. This was the perfect opportunity to see how smoothly, intentionally, and flawlessly the healthcare system—and my future—would look.</p>

<p>My first appointment with her was a simple CT scan. I got to the waiting room early, eager to have my first conversation with my first patient. She had just had surgery to remove a large tumor, and I had briefly stopped by during her recovery to introduce myself, but this would be the first time we would have a meaningful conversation.</p>

<p>After she arrived, we went up to the registration desk to check in. As an afterthought after we had turned around to sit in the waiting area, the receptionist said, “Just so you know, one of the scans is still pending.” New to this world of insurance and paperwork, I had no idea what she meant, so I came back to the desk and asked her to explain. Ashley was scheduled for three CT scans due to the extent of the cancer’s spread. Two were approved by her insurance, while one was still pending. I asked what would happen if Ashley got the scan and it was later denied by the insurance. The receptionist looked puzzled. “I’m not sure.” “Is there someone we could talk to for more information?” “I don’t know.” I wondered if it would be best to wait for the approval before getting the scan, but the receptionist quickly nixed that idea. “Due to the severity of the patient’s condition, the doctor wants to go through with the scans.”</p>

<p>CT scans are not cheap, and I was worried that Ashley might get stuck with the bill for one. To make matters worse, Ashley was a refugee with no job (she was too sick to work) and six children at home, making her husband’s job as a cashier the sole source of income for the family. A bill for a CT scan would be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Not knowing what to do, I frantically called Ashley’s primary care physician (whom I was assigned to through this elective) for advice. He wasn’t sure what to do either, but told me to bring it up with the doctor who had ordered the CT, with whom we had an appointment later that day.</p>

<p>During the appointment, I waited my turn to ask the doctor to help with the insurance issue. Towards the end, the doctor discussed the plan with the resident and left the room without asking if we had any questions. I (wrongly) assumed he would be coming back, but I did not want to miss the opportunity, so I brought the issue up with the resident. When I was done explaining the situation, the resident just looked at me, face emotionless, and gave me an “ok”. He left the room shortly after, having only answered our medical questions, as if nothing else was wrong.</p>

<p>The first month of my medical school’s curriculum stressed the importance of socioeconomic factors on healthcare, but this experience blew my mind. What gave an insurance company the right to put up any resistance whatsoever to covering this patient’s CT scans? Why did the resident feel it was ok to just ignore the problem? Why wasn’t anyone in the hospital acting as an advocate for my patient? There needs to be a concerted effort on the side of medical school admissions to admit more applicants who care about their <em>patients</em>, not their textbooks or paperwork. And after the admissions process is over, curricula need to teach how to take care of the actual patients as much as they address treating their diseases. Doctor’s test scores won’t matter if patients can’t afford their treatment.</p>
