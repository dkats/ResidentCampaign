<h1>Irreversible Psychosis</h1>

<p><em>Note: Patient information was changed to protect privacy.</em></p>

<p><u>Medical School, Year 3</u></p>

<p>During my two-week rotation in the inpatient psychiatric ward, we took care of a patient named Steve. The best way I can describe him is like a grandpa who you can sit next to on the couch, listening to his old war stories for hours. He was bald, stern-faced, and had a tattoo of a bald eagle on his chest.</p>

<p>At the time, his two main issues were dementia and psychosis. He had a long history of schizophrenia, but was doing well living independently. However, the pharmacy that supplied his medications had just gone out of business, leaving Steve (assisted by his case worker) scrambling to find another one. It turned out that he was allergic to the generic medication sold by nearby stores, and it took several days to find a pharmacy that provided what Steve needed. By this point, his schizophrenia was completely out of control. Steve had become increasingly psychotic and paranoid: everywhere he looked, he thought he saw crimes being committed and would constantly call the police. He also believed his case worker was plotting against him, leading to him being assigned a temporary case worker, who had never worked with him before.</p>

<p>Soon after, he was placed in our psychiatric unit to restart his medications and to bring him back to his baseline. Unfortunately, in the days before he arrived at the hospital, he had called and cancelled his Medicaid Part D, which covers the cost of his medication. While he was in the hospital, this didn’t matter, but he would not be able to get his medications after going home.</p>

<p>After being restarted on his medications, Steve gradually returned to his baseline and was eventually well enough to leave. The new case manager told me that the insurance situation was worked out, so I excitedly passed the good news onto the team and got ready to send Steve home after two weeks in the hospital.</p>

<p>During his case manager’s last visit (at the end of which we hoped Steve would be able to leave the hospital), we were told that the insurance was actually not completely fixed, and Steve would have to use an out-of-state pharmacy that would take two or three days to process his prescriptions. We could not send Steve home knowing that he wouldn’t be able to get any medications for a few days, so we decided to keep him in the hospital for longer than was medically necessary—essentially like a hotel.</p>

<p>To me, this didn’t make any sense. Steve was getting increasingly agitated from being in the hospital for so long (psychiatric wards are not exactly calming environments) and he really had no <em>good</em> reason to be there. I asked the resident if the hospital’s pharmacy could just send him home with several days’ worth of medications, but that was also not an option (I’m still not entirely sure why). While Steve wasn’t being actively harmed by staying a few extra days, he was taking up a bed in a busy psychiatric unit. As a result of him staying longer, we did not have space for other patients who genuinely needed to be there. That was the most frustrating thing for me: knowing that other patients were going to receive worse care because of a completely correctable mistake.</p>

<p>Why was there no system in place to fix the cancelled insurance? Steve was actively psychotic from being off of his medications when he called Medicaid. I expected there to be a safeguard to prevent patients with active mental illnesses from making mistakes like these. Maybe the mistakes could not be prevented in the first place, but they should at least be correctable after the fact. Steve’s story was fairly straightforward, why couldn’t we just hit an “undo” button? The whole point of government medical insurance is to help people, which it definitely does, but what happened to Steve was ridiculous. First, do no harm.</p>
