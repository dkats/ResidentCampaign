<p>My name is Dan Kats and I want to be <em>your</em> pediatric resident!</p>

<p>I went into medical school with "an open mind," but always knowing deep down that I would end up choosing pediatrics. From my time as an extracurricular enrichment math and chess teacher, to running a community service group for children with autism and other developmental disabilities, to playing with whatever kids happen to come to their parents' doctors' visits, I've always loved the energy and curiosity that kids have. As clich√© as it sounds, the first day of my pediatrics rotation was one of my favorite&mdash;if not my <em>favorite</em>&mdash;day of medical school, and the days that followed were just as incredible. I started on the inpatient portion of the rotation and was assigned to work the first weekend. As the second weekend approached (after having worked 12 days in a row), I was sad to have time away from the hospital. I loved the patients, I loved the residents, I loved the attendings, and I loved the atmosphere.</p>

<p>For my career, I obviously haven't had the opportunity to try everything, so I can't have an informed opinion on whether I'm going to be a general pediatrician or a specialist, but I have loved being involved with clinical informatics research, and hope to continue that. On top of that, I had an incredible two months with <a href="http://brianskotko.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Brian Skotko</a> in the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/services/treatmentprograms.aspx?id=1701" target="_blank">Down Syndrome Program</a>, and absolutely want to keep working with that population.</p>

<p>During my first third-year rotation, I watched a patient be declared brain dead. I had seen a death previously, during an EMT ride-along, but this one was different. The death I saw with the EMTs was someone who was blue and cold, having been dead for a long time. The brain dead patient, though, was warm. Her heart was beating. Her chest was rising and falling. I had a lot of feelings that I didn't know how to process, and I entered into a funk for a few days. On the second day, after work, I pulled out my laptop and just <a href="thoughts/The-Executioner.html">wrote</a>. The next day, I felt much better; I was still sad and spent a lot of time thinking about that patient, but I stopped fixating on her. Since then, I've been <a href="thoughts.html">writing more</a> and hope to keep practicing going forward. Hopefully, I can use this to become a better advocate for my patients and the greater community as a whole.</p>
